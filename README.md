# MBA Admission Prediction - Data Alchemy Competition (SRM)

We participated in the **Data-Alchemy** competition hosted by SlugNPlug at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. Our task was to build a machine learning model to predict MBA admissions outcomes using a dataset containing features like GPA, GMAT scores, work experience, and demographics.

## Model & Approach
- **Algorithm Used**: Random Forest
- **Accuracy Achieved**: 98%
- **Why Random Forest?**
  - Handles both numerical and categorical data
  - Captures non-linear relationships
  - Robust to missing values and outliers
  - Reduces overfitting using bagging 
  - Provides feature importance insights

## Results & Insights
- We successfully trained and evaluated the model within the given 1.5-hour timeframe.
- Presented our findings and approach in a PPT adhering to competition guidelines.
- Overcame challenges such as data preprocessing and visualization.

## Acknowledgments
A huge shoutout to **Shashikumar Ezhilarasu** and **Kavya** for their invaluable contributions!
